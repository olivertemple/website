            <!--<button onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/olivertemple/geometric-images'""><span class='title'>Geometric Images</span><br>Python</button><button>test</button>-->
            <div2>
                <button onclick="window.open('https://github.com/olivertemple/geometric-images')">Geometric Images</button><br>
                <p1><span class='language'>Python</span> This is a small python program that will generate geometrical images based on user input using the 'matplotlib' library. Both 2D and 3D images can be generated, in different colours and shapes of the same dimensions can be overlaid. This was my first ever project in which I implemented a GUI, making the project much more user friendly, as the user does not need to understand python or the terminal. I enjoyed the challenge that this project gave me, I learned a lot about the python libraries 'matplotlib' and 'pysimplegui'.</p1>

                <button onclick="window.open('https://github.com/olivertemple/bulk-file-renamer')">Bulk File Renamer</button><br>
                <p1><span class='language'>Python</span> This is another simple program that will rename all of the files with a specific file extension in a specific directory using the python library 'os'. The user specifies the file extension, directory and the naming scheme to follow, as well as a number to start at. This was my second project in which i implemented a GUI, which strengthened my knowledge and confidence with the 'pysimplegui' module.</p1>

                <button onclick="window.open('https://github.com/olivertemple/message-sender-google-messages')">Message Sender For Google Messages</button><br>
                <p1><span class="language">Python</span> This is a simple program that sends the content in a text file to a recipient of the users choice, one sentence at a time by controlling the computer's peripherals (through the use of the python library 'pyautogui'), and navigating to <a href='https://messages.google.com/web' style="color:#f05454" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#30475e'"
                    onMouseOut="this.style.color='#f05454'" >messages for web</a>, starting a chat and pasting the content. I did this project for a bit of fun and to see how python can be used to control a computer's peripherals.</p1>

                <p1><span class="language">CSS/HTML</span> This is a website for me to learn and practice web development, as well as showcase some of my favorite projects. This is my first website for which I have started learning html and css, rather than just googling the solutions. I have thoroughly enjoyed working on this website and I hope to continue working on it in the future. I have learnt lots about both css and html and how they interact with each other.</p1>
